**Close your eyes.**<br>
Picture a red apple.<br>

Is it glossy? Is it matte?<br>
Does it have a stem?

Now imagine closing your eyes… and there is nothing.<br>
Not darkness. Not blur. **Just absence**.
</aside>

This is a record and repository for all of my learnings surrounding **aphantasia**, and **gaining mental imagery** after roughly forty years of not having it and not being aware of it as a phenomenon.

To start with, here are some videos about Aphantasia, including several I've made talking about the topic and my own progress:

### Image Streaming 
Image streaming is really about developing an awareness of subconscious thought and the regular practice of observing it, and amplifying it's "voice". It's inventor, Win Wenger, teaches and explains it thoroughly in his book, *The Einstein Factor*. In using Image Streaming, you learn to strengthen your mental imagery, even if it's currently very weak or undetectable (i.e. you have aphantasia).
