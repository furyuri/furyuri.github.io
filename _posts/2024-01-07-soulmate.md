Are we...***soulmates***?  
Perhaps we lived together in another life...  
Or perhaps we were the same being, a billion light-years away.  

Twins, separated at birth - made from the same spirit.  
The baker, saved part of the dough mass  
Then returned and formed me - just one week later.  

"A day for a year, a day for a year. "  
Or something like that...  

So when we dance, it just makes sense. We orbit each other, we fuse and combine.  
Returning to our original state, into something more divine.  
Or perhaps more earthly...?  

Best friends...siblings...lovers, life-partners...who can know, who can tell?  
When weavers began, what was their spell?  
There's certainly one way to find out...  

Freedom, joy, love and play.  
Heartbreak and tears, growing and learning.  
All features, no bugs. Light touches and yearning...and hugs...  
And everything else.  

"To live will be an awfully big adventure"  
And so it has been, and so it will be.  

But I can't help wondering, if it's just starting...for me.
