Heart touched and dissolved into dust.
The light of stars sprinkle across an infinite, empty expanse.

Painted out expertly, each put into its place...
Only the artist knows where and why.

Each shines gently, each twinkle a rippling heartbeat.

The universe retracts, and lines of light return back after an eternity.
They carry the memories of void, of cold and warmth, of peoples and life.

There are no cracks, no seams. I am one.
But my heart aches to be broken...
And to be thrust out...back across that dark canvas.
