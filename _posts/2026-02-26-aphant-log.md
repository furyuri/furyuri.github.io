- More evidence that my son, Josh (10 y/o) has pretty vivid mental imagery. Last weekend, after telling him about me hearing piano music, later that night (Saturday) he had trouble falling asleep, kept hearing piano. He also told me that same night, when I suggested he count sheep (and visualize them), that he can't hold the image of the sheep for much longer than 20 seconds (...interesting)
- I realized recently that during near-sleep states (likely theta) while practicing autogogia, and image-streaming that the flashes of colors mixed with strong emotion I've experienced (not very often at this point, but probably 1-2 times when I get in a good flow) is likely a form of synesthesia.
- Today 2/26/2026, I had two hypnogogic flashes while coming out of sleep. After the first flash, I had this realization or belief that I had my right slightly eye open, and that by opening it slightly again I was able to trigger the second flash. I don't remember the subject of the first flash, but the second one was clearly a baseball that was behaving like something in a pinball machine, with other small baseballs bouncing off of them. It has a clear tie to a memory of some sort of game where the balls split and increase...it's not Araknoid...it's some other video game that I still can't recall. Update: It was ***JezzBall***!! Interesting that the same week I reconnect with a friend I haven't interacted with in ~25 years, that I have a hypnogogic vision of a game I haven't seen for 25 years!
- I found out a couple nights ago or so, that to see autogogic images, that I actually have to "hunt" for them and focus on them with my eyes as opposed to just looking with a soft gaze into space (with eyes closed or open). Engaging the eyes perhaps involves the visual system in a way that makes imagery appear/possible.
- 2/24 - Found Dr. Merlin Montels research articles (he co-authored with other scientists). New articles even as recent as 02/2026.
- 2/23 - "Death" Journey. Scary, horrifying. Everything was made up, nothing real. Synesthesia of everything. Before that, added Aphantasia page to website, including aphant logs.
- 2/19 - I started listening to "The Einstein Factor" raising and practicing deeper levels of awareness including to the subconscious thought (e.g. autogogic imagery), seems to be a key in encoding, retrieving memory and enhancing mental imagery. The visuals, etc. are there, it's about learning to "build the antenna" that can pick them up, in part. Started image-streaming, incorporating autogogia practice with it. Heard piano music playing briefly during one session. Faint images, colors, flashes of light, movement and voices when going deep, close to sleeping, but awake enough to keep narrating most of the experience.
- Made a bunch of YT videos during this month (Feb) about Aphantasia, SDAM, etc.
- 2/12 - Big emotional release opening up with therapist about family issues related to being wanted/belonging.
- 2/9 - Started tracking / documenting Aphantasia journey since 2024 
- 2/6 - Started Bacopa Monnieri (again) to see long term affects on memory. Previously took inconsistently and not long enough
- 2/5 - huge emotional release (break down) and reckoning with old patterns and deep wounds of worthlessness, self-abandonment and shrinking. Had to reach out to therapist and friends due to being in very strange waters. - Seems like it's having an effect. Whether it's the image streaming, the Bacopa, the juggling, using visual thought during every day conversations and thought...it's improving my recall and cognition.
- 2/3 - Started light practice of juggling (bilateral coordination)
- 1/26 - New aphantasia support friend to talk to.
- 1/28 - Decided to revisit autogogia training.
- 1/16 - Started Telepathy Tapes (non-verbal, subconscious, belief systems, divine help)
- 1/12 - Started "Belonging" Toko-pa Turner (Main wound healing)
