Last night I did image streaming and realized that for the past month or so, maybe longer, that I've been experiencing a form of synesthesia - in which I get flashes of color and/or flashes of what a color feels like (so, no visual, but the feeling of "dark teal", etc.)

I also experienced a "shuttering" effect - going between autogogic representations of lips and a visual flash of an image of lips in a rapid succession.

Image streaming especially when very tired/falling asleep has lead to incredible new experiences in regards to mental imagery. I'm becoming more sensitive to these faint signals. It's super-fun, though sometimes scary. 

Last night I imagined my "temple" - a mental world in which there are about 5 distinct locations, starting with my "meditation" circle. During this episode, I stepped down from my circle into a watery depth (this is a new feature, not normally part of its construct), and started sinking way down, as opposed to the water being a few inches deep (like when Eleven, Stranger things, walks through the "darkness"). I actually felt a little bit of terror, and did not pursue that train of thought.
