My spirit yearns...my heart quakes.  
My body trembles...my being shakes.

I charge, and stumble, I grasp and I reach.  
I swim through the waves, my eyes fixed on the beach.

There's power...and wonder...and magic in love.  
It's a spirit, a flame, a dragon, a dove.

It draws me, it calls - an irresistible pull.  
"It will fill me" I think...It will help me feel full.

Dripping and gasping - I've made it on shore.  
I consume it, I drink, yet panting for more.

The sun shines...the rays cascade.  
The wind sings...love's a blade.

Tired now, drifting, into sweet sleep...  
It cuts me, I bleed. Yet, I want it that way.
