The hummmmm, humm, hum . . .  
. . . of ants.

Tiny . . . little . . . ants.  

Millions of them . . .  
*Billions* of them!

Living, exploring, breathing, loving, killing . . . and . . .   
. . . *dying*.

Unaware of being watched . . . most of them.

A swarming single entity of distributed intelligence.

Their lives so short, yes . . . but full of meaning.

They hum, humm, hummmmm . . .

And gently touch each other for the most briefest of moments.

And in these moments . . . they say:

"I see you."

*I see you.*
