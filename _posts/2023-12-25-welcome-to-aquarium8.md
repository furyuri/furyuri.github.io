## New Journey, New Website
My old website (urifrazier.com) has officially been retired. After around 7 years of loyal service, it was time for a new hosting option, new technology and of course, a new design. My previous site was mostly a portfolio site that was initially just something I could show potential employers as I sought to break into the web development industry.

But now I have worked in the field full-time since 2018, and its original purpose has been fully satisfied. As I embark on expressing *my* new external purpose via art, poetry, and storytelling...as I seek to exercise and develop my creative muscle fibers, this site will also experience rebirth and serve as a vehicle for communication, record-keeping, connection and discovery. My new website name is...***Aquarium 8***.

See my [About](/about) page for more information, and stay tuned for future posts that explain more about my vision and what plans and goals I have for myself and this site.

## Pursuing Purpose Through Art
But as a preview, it has become very clear to me that I am a "people-person". I *love* people. 

Relationships with people (especially the kind, warm & generous variety) are the most important things in my life. Helping people—bringing them joy, laughter, and inspiration—brings me a very strong sense of satisfaction and fulfillment in life.

While I could pursue completely new paths in which I can help people with basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter, it would require me to basically start from scratch, learning an entirely new trade, skill-set, etc. Instead, "nourishing the spirit" is something I can provide through Art and Creativity—an area in which I have a pretty decent foundation in from years past.

So that's the plan in a nutshell. 

And yet, I have never pursued art vigorously. Even in my youth when I was most active, it was mostly just a very enjoyable hobby. That all changes in 2024. This entire year (of 2023) has been a tale of various synchronicities falling gently into place and creating a beautiful path that I cannot help but walk. A magical door of opportunity that cannot be ignored.
