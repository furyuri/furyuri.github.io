While falling to sleep, and while in-between the first and second sleep, and early after waking: I experienced imagery that was rather visual. I remember seeing an owl (a large one), an owl's face. I must've been in the theta state or close to it during these times, but I can say there were flashes (mostly monochrome) of people, things moving, etc. 

Eyes closed, would be looking and tracking behind eyelids for autogogic imagery, but there was so much visual flashes / subconscious imagery happening, and often it was happening one after the next in quick succession...felt too fast, hectic even at times.

This is a few days (4 nights) after the horrific "DEATH Journey."

I know I'm doing a lot of different things to practice visualization and improve on my hypophantasia recently (I feel moderately comfortable calling it that), but since it's been three weeks of me taking Bacopa Monnieri every day, I feel like the improvement may be due in large part to that.

I'm also noticing a clearer mind, better memory recall for names, etc. - but almost an effect of my mind moving too fast...in a way that is electrifying and slightly overwhelming and stressful. Could be due to still fighting off this respiratory bug/virus.

P.S. 

New vocabulary:
- hynopompic (vs. hypnogogic)
- myclonic (jerks, movement)
- eigengrau
