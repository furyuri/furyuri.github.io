How can we walk...when we are shackled in chains?  
We can barely move, barely breathe.

This false connection...this web we've spun.  
All this, to get tangled in our own trap.

Only ***the Earth*** can teach us, reach us...  
Heal us and fulfill us.

Though it bleeds...it remembers us, its children  
In its dying moments.

It calls us to return.

Not to a god who will enslave us in chains,  
But to our brothers, sisters, mothers and fathers...

And to our ancestors who before us have lain.

<h2>Epilogue</h2>
The Earth is suffering, grieving - just as we all are, or have been doing in the past. Our ancestors call upon us to treat the planet gently, with honor, respect and care. 

It has so much capacity to absorb and digest our tears of sorrow and to heal our wounded hearts. 

These thoughts (and this poem) came to me while doing some personal grieving and healing work out by the Pacific coast at Fort Stevens State Park in Oregon, U.S.A.
