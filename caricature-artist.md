    My name is Uri Frazier and I am a freelance caricature artist living the Pacific Northwest (PNW) - *I mostly work with clients in Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington*.  
    <br>
    I offer caricatures for your parties of all types.  
    **Birthday Party** or **Wedding Reception**? Yes!
    Got a **Graduation Party**, **Halloween Party**, **Christmas or Winter Holiday Event**? You betcha! I also do corporate events and parties.

        Even if your event isn't in Portland, I have car and will travel. So whether you live in Beaverton, Salem or Vancouver WA, I've got you covered. I can also drive out to Tigard, Hillsboro, Gresham, Aloha, and Lake Oswego. <br><br>So, to put it simply, if you're an hour or less from Portland, I can help you out. If it's more than an hour then just ask me (see the contact info above) and I'll see what I can do.

## Digital Caricatures
I also accept commissions from time-to-time. So if you would like me to draw a caricature based off of a photo, then feel free to reach out to me and let's talk.
