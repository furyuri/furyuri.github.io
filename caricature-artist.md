        Even if your event isn't in Portland, I have car and will travel. So whether you live in Beaverton, Salem or Vancouver WA, I've got you covered. I can also drive out to Tigard, Hillsboro, Gresham, Aloha, and Lake Oswego. So, to put it simply, if you're an hour or less from Portland, I can help you out. If it's more than an hour then just ask me (see the contact info above) and I'll see what I can do.
