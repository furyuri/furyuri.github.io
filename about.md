Hello, hello! My name is Uri. This is my site. This is an **Octopus** that likes to draw. 🐙

Okay, okay. Seriously though - I'm an artist and web designer / developer working in the lovely Portland, Oregon metro area. I enjoy ecstatic dance, anime, sci-fi, fantasy, manga, comics, running, learning languages, and playing with my kiddos. 

Right now I'm focused on a new journey: diving deep into visual arts, storytelling and poetry.

<aside markdown=1> **Side note**: A few years back (in 2020) I graduated from Portland Community College's Website Development and Design program, and absolutely loved it. If you're ever looking for a computer-related class there, I'd highly recommend instructor [Juan Maldonado](https://spot.pcc.edu/~jmaldona/), my favorite instructor by far.

My goal for this website is multi-faceted and includes:
- Bringing joy and entertainment through art, poetry, music and other creative endeavors.
- Creating a delightful web experience.
- Providing a way for people (like you, dear reader) to easily contact me, request my services, and buy cool, geeky products.

At any rate, thanks for visiting and I hope you enjoy my site! Feel free to leave me feedback - good or bad. 🫣😁

\- Uri
