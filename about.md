My name is Uri. This is my site. This is an **Octopus** that likes to draw. üêô

I'm an artist and web designer / developer working in the lovely Portland, Oregon metro area. I enjoy comics, running, learning languages and also have a pretty good eye for design. Right now I'm focused on a new journey: diving deep into visual arts, storytelling and poetry.

A few years back I graduated from Portland Community College's Website Development and Design program, and absolutely loved it. If you're ever looking for a computer-related class there, I'd highly recommend instructor [Juan Maldonado](https://spot.pcc.edu/~jmaldona/), my favorite instructor by far.

A few links that will surely enhance your life. Say "yes" to joy and laughter. ^__^

- [Mission to Zyxx](https://missiontozyxx.space)
    - The greatest sci-fi improv/comedy series ever. "Yass, Papa. Yasss."
- [Wolf 359](https://wolf359.fm/)
    - Starts slow, but really ramps up after sesason 1.
